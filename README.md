Making Biggest Hollow Cuboid with 10,000 Bricks

Start

  ↓
  
Initialize brick properties and count (10,000)

  ↓
  
Convert to mathematical model with brick units

  ↓
  
Solve constraint: l×w×h - (l-4)×(w-4)×(h-4) = 200

  ↓
  
Find optimal integer dimensions (l, w, h)

  ↓
  
Calculate outer and inner dimensions in mm

  ↓
  
Generate brick placement coordinates

  ↓
  
Visualize: Top view and Side view

  ↓
  
Output results and visualization

  ↓
